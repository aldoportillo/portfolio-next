## Introduction

Today we will be reversing a linked list. This is a common interview question and a good way to test your understanding of linked lists.

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence. The first element is called the head, and the last element called the tail points to nil/null.
