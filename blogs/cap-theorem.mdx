Theorem: Distributed systems can only guarantee 2 out of 3: CAP.

## Acronym

C - Consistency - If two requests are made from different sources against different "nodes" off the distributed store, you will get the same data returned.
A - Availability - If two requests are made from different sources against different "nodes" off the distributed store, you will get a response.
P - Partition Tolerance - If nodes are disconnected, the system will continue to work. Assumed as constant in distributed systems.

## DB Types

### CA Database - Consistent and Available

Not partition tolerant.

Databases - SQL: PostgreSQL and MySQL.

### AP Database - Available and Partition Tolerant

Access to the same dataset but no guarantee every request will receive the same response.

Databases - NoSQL: Mongo and HBase

### CP Database - Consistent and Partition Tolerant

Guaranteed that every request receives the same response.

Databases: Spanner, Dynamo, Cosmos and Cockroach

## Implementing Consistency

Foundations: Raft and MVCC

### Raft

Distributed Consensus Algorithm provides atomic writes and consistent reads.

#### **Raft Leader**

- Leader is elected
- Coordinates all writes, proposes commands to followers
- Only allowed to serve authoritative up-to-date

#### **Atomic Writes(Replication)**

Commands are proposed to the Raft Leader replica and distributed to followers but only accepted when a quorum of followers have acknowledged receiving it. This helps with consistency.

### Multiversion concurrency control - MVCC

Ensures consistent data is always present without any overlap for transactions.

## Applying CAP in real world for comprehension

### Bank

Two ATMs support 3 operations: withdraw, deposit and check balance. These ATMs don't have a central database.

Prioritizing Consistency - The ATM may refuse to accept deposits or withdraws when there is a partition. This leads to a sad customer.

Prioritizing Availability - The customer can withdraw the full balance from both ATMs when there is a partition. This leads to a negative balance.

## Conclusion

This is just a high level overview on the CAP theorem. The world is more complex than this. CAP theorem assumes there is a partition, but if there isn't, we also have latency vs consistency in the PACELC theorem.
